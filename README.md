#OpenCV_AgarBot_Programme
Hi this is my bot for agar.io and clones like it.

This program uses OpenCV numpy, win32api, grabscreen from PIL/pillow. It is written in python. If you would like to help then ask i guess.

System requirments:
- Fast processor
- Internet
- 1680 x 1050 screen. (You can edit screensizex and screensizey in main for your resulution)
- Windows 7 or better

How to install/run:

Put main.py and grabscreen.py in a folder, open agar.io fullscreen and run, the program will count down, then run.
