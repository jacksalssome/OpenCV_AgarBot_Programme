OpenCV_AgarBot_Programme

Hi this is my bot for agar.io and clones like it.

This program uses OpenCV numpy, win32api, grabscreen from PIL/pillow. It is written in python. If you would like to help then ask i guess.

System requirments:
- Fast processor
- Internet
- 1680 x 1050 screen. (Testing branch has auto detection)
- Windows 7 or better

How to install/run:

Put main.py and grabscreen.py in a folder, open agar.io fullscreen and run, the program will count down, then run.

Todo:

Currently looking into rewriting in C++ due to python no longer being a sutible language for this type of project.

- Port OBS's screen capture so i can get some sort of reasonable framerate. (C++ to python)
- Figgure out how OBS captures the screen.
